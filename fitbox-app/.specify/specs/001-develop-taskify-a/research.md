# Research: Taskify Implementation Technologies

## Research Summary

All technical choices were specified in user requirements, but architectural patterns needed investigation for optimal implementation.

## Technology Decisions

### Next.js 14 App Router + tRPC Integration

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with tRPC for API layer

**Rationale**: 
- Full-stack TypeScript with end-to-end type safety
- App Router provides modern React patterns with Server Components
- tRPC eliminates API layer complexity while maintaining type safety
- Integrated development experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate frontend/backend: More complex deployment and development
- REST API with OpenAPI: Less type safety, more boilerplate
- GraphQL: Overkill for this project's complexity

### @dnd-kit for Drag and Drop

**Decision**: Use @dnd-kit/core with @dnd-kit/sortable

**Rationale**:
- Modern, accessible drag-and-drop library
- Built specifically for React with excellent TypeScript support
- Handles complex Kanban scenarios (nested droppables, touch devices)
- Active maintenance and modern React patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- react-beautiful-dnd: Popular but development has slowed
- react-dnd: More complex, steeper learning curve
- Native HTML5 drag and drop: Poor mobile support, less accessible

### Zustand for State Management

**Decision**: Use Zustand for client-side state management

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight with minimal boilerplate
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Perfect for medium-complexity applications
- Easy integration with persistence

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: More boilerplate for this project size
- React Context + useReducer: Would work but less ergonomic
- Jotai: Atomic approach unnecessary for this scope

### Prisma + PostgreSQL

**Decision**: Use Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database

**Rationale**:
- Type-safe database queries
- Excellent migration system
- Great developer experience with Prisma Studio
- Production-ready PostgreSQL for reliability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct SQL: Less type safety, more boilerplate
- Other ORMs: Prisma has the best TypeScript integration
- SQLite: Good for development but PostgreSQL better for production patterns

### Session Management Strategy

**Decision**: Custom JWT + database hybrid approach

**Rationale**:
- No authentication required but need session persistence
- 2-hour session duration requirement
- Simple user selection from predefined list
- Database storage allows session management and cleanup

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure localStorage: No server-side persistence
- NextAuth.js: Overkill for no-authentication requirement  
- Pure JWT: No revocation capability

## Integration Patterns

### tRPC + React Query + Zustand

**Pattern**: Use tRPC for server communication, React Query for server state caching, Zustand for client-side UI state

**Implementation Approach**:
- tRPC handles all API communication with type safety
- React Query manages server state, caching, and loading states  
- Zustand manages UI state (selected user, sidebar open, etc.)
- Clear separation of concerns

### @dnd-kit + Zustand Integration

**Pattern**: Zustand store manages Kanban board state, @dnd-kit handles drag events

**Implementation Approach**:
- Zustand store contains current board state (columns, tasks)
- @dnd-kit DndContext handles drag events
- On drop completion, update Zustand store and trigger tRPC mutation
- Optimistic updates for smooth user experience

## Performance Considerations

### Drag and Drop Optimization

- Use @dnd-kit's built-in performance optimizations
- Implement virtualization if task lists exceed 100 items
- Debounce server updates during drag operations
- Use React.memo for task card components

### State Management Efficiency

- Zustand selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
- React Query provides intelligent caching and background updates
- Prisma query optimization for minimal database round trips

## Accessibility Features

### @dnd-kit Accessibility

- Built-in keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements during drag operations
- Focus management during drag and drop
- High contrast mode compatibility

### Application Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for dynamic content
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Color contrast compliance for task assignments

## Architecture Summary

The selected technology stack provides:
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript from database to UI
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and hot reload
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth drag-and-drop interactions  
- **Accessibility**: Built-in support for users with disabilities
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports future feature additions

All research confirms the chosen technologies are optimal for the Taskify requirements.
