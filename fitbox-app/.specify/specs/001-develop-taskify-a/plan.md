# Implementation Plan: Taskify - Team Productivity Platform

**Branch**: `001-develop-taskify-a` | **Date**: 2025-09-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-develop-taskify-a/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path ✓
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION) ✓
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below ✓
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md ⚠️
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ⚠️
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section ⚠️
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md) ⚠️
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command ⚠️
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Taskify is a team productivity platform featuring Kanban-style task management with 5 predefined users (1 PM, 4 engineers) across 3 sample projects. Core functionality includes drag-and-drop task movement, unlimited commenting with user-specific edit/delete permissions, task assignment, and visual distinction of user-assigned tasks. Technical approach uses Next.js with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database via Prisma, tRPC API, Zustand state management, @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop, React Query for server state, and 2-hour session persistence.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Next.js 14+  
**Primary Dependencies**: @dnd-kit/core, Zustand, Prisma, tRPC, React Query, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (modern browsers supporting drag-and-drop)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend in Next.js app structure)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms task status updates, smooth drag-and-drop at 60fps  
**Constraints**: 2-hour session persistence, 5 predefined users max, 3 sample projects  
**Scale/Scope**: Small demo app, 5 concurrent users, ~100 tasks per project max

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (Next.js full-stack app - under 3 limit) ✓
- Using framework directly? (Direct Next.js, Prisma, tRPC usage) ✓
- Single data model? (Direct Prisma models, no DTOs) ✓ 
- Avoiding patterns? (No Repository/UoW - direct Prisma queries) ✓

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (Auth, Kanban, Comments as separate libs) ✓
- Libraries listed: 
  - taskify-auth: Session management without passwords
  - taskify-kanban: Drag-and-drop board logic  
  - taskify-comments: Comment CRUD with ownership
  - taskify-data: Prisma models and queries
- CLI per library: (--help/--version/--format support planned) ✓
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned ✓

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? ✓
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (Planned) ✓
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? ✓
- Real dependencies used? (Real PostgreSQL, not mocks) ✓
- Integration tests for: new libraries, tRPC contracts, Prisma schemas ✓
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (Console + file logging planned) ✓
- Frontend logs → backend? (tRPC error reporting) ✓
- Error context sufficient? (Full stack traces planned) ✓

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (0.1.0) ✓
- BUILD increments on every change? ✓
- Breaking changes handled? (N/A for initial version) ✓

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Next.js provides both frontend and backend in single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Unknowns from Technical Context
All technical choices have been specified in the user requirements - no NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain.

### Research Tasks Required
1. **Next.js 14 App Router best practices** for project structure with tRPC
2. **@dnd-kit integration patterns** with Zustand state management  
3. **Prisma schema design** for multi-user task management
4. **tRPC + React Query patterns** for real-time-ish updates
5. **Session persistence strategies** for 2-hour requirement without authentication

### Research Completed ✓

All research has been completed and documented in research.md with findings on:
- Next.js 14 App Router + tRPC integration patterns
- @dnd-kit implementation with Zustand state management
- Prisma schema design for multi-user task management
- Session management without traditional authentication
- Performance optimization strategies

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions finalized ✓

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✓

### Data Model Extraction ✓
Extracted 5 key entities from feature specification:
- User (5 predefined with roles)
- Project (3 sample projects)  
- Task (with status, position, assignment)
- Comment (with ownership rules)
- Session (2-hour duration management)

**Output**: data-model.md with complete Prisma schema ✓

### API Contracts Generated ✓
Generated comprehensive tRPC API contracts covering:
- Authentication (user selection, session management)
- Users (get all predefined users)
- Projects (get all sample projects)  
- Tasks (CRUD, status updates, position changes, assignment)
- Comments (CRUD with ownership restrictions)

**Output**: contracts/api-spec.json, contracts/signalr-spec.md ✓

### Integration Test Scenarios ✓
Extracted test scenarios from user stories covering:
- User selection flow
- Project navigation  
- Kanban drag-and-drop operations
- Task detail interactions
- Comment system with ownership rules
- Session persistence validation

**Output**: quickstart.md with comprehensive test scenarios ✓

### CLAUDE.md Context Update ✓
Agent context file will be updated with:
- Technology stack (Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, @dnd-kit, Zustand)
- Project structure and conventions
- Key architectural decisions
- Recent implementation progress

**Output**: CLAUDE.md in repository root (pending)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach ✓

### Task Generation Strategy ✓
The /tasks command will generate tasks using the detailed implementation sequence documented in `implementation-sequence.md`.

**Key Improvements Made**:
- Each task now references specific files and line numbers in the specification documents
- Clear dependencies between tasks (what must complete before what)
- Specific file paths and implementation requirements
- Cross-references between plan, contracts, data-model, and quickstart files

**From Database Foundation** (`implementation-sequence.md` Phase 1):
1. Create `prisma/schema.prisma` using schema from `data-model.md` lines 134-228
2. Create `prisma/seed.ts` implementing sample data from `data-model.md` lines 260-276
3. Setup Prisma client configuration in `src/lib/prisma.ts`

**From tRPC API Layer** (`implementation-sequence.md` Phase 2):
4. Setup tRPC base configuration (3 files) with session middleware from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 236-247
5. Create `src/server/api/routers/auth.ts` implementing 3 endpoints from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 18-36
6. Create `src/server/api/routers/users.ts` implementing 2 endpoints from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 38-50
7. Create `src/server/api/routers/projects.ts` implementing 2 endpoints from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 52-64
8. Create `src/server/api/routers/tasks.ts` implementing 5 endpoints from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 66-96
9. Create `src/server/api/routers/comments.ts` implementing 4 endpoints from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 98-122
10. Assemble main router from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 5-16

**From Frontend Foundation** (`implementation-sequence.md` Phase 3):
11. Setup tRPC client using patterns from `contracts/signalr-spec.md` lines 249-282
12. Create Zustand stores using integration patterns from `research.md`
13. Implement session management using 2-hour requirement from `spec.md` line 73

**From UI Components** (`implementation-sequence.md` Phase 4):
14. Create user selection page implementing flow from `quickstart.md` lines 64-68
15. Create project list page implementing flow from `quickstart.md` lines 70-76  
16. Create Kanban board implementing drag-and-drop from `quickstart.md` lines 78-83
17. Create task detail modal implementing permissions from `quickstart.md` lines 85-108

**From Integration Testing** (`implementation-sequence.md` Phase 5):
18. Create contract tests for all tRPC endpoints
19. Create E2E tests for user journeys from `quickstart.md` lines 62-120
20. Create drag-and-drop integration tests

### Task Ordering Strategy
1. **Contract Tests First**: All tRPC endpoint tests (RED phase)
2. **Model Implementation**: Prisma schema and database setup
3. **API Implementation**: tRPC routers to make contract tests pass (GREEN)
4. **Frontend Components**: React components for UI
5. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user scenarios
6. **Styling & Polish**: Tailwind CSS and UX improvements

**Parallel Execution Markers [P]**:
- All contract tests can run in parallel (independent)
- All model creation tasks can run in parallel
- Frontend components can be developed in parallel to backend

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
