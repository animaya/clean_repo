# Feature Specification: Taskify - Team Productivity Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-taskify-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members, assign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature, let's call it 'Create Taskify,' let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined. I want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three different sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' 'In Review,' and 'Done.' There will be no login for this application as this is just the very first testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card, you should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board. You should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task card, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick from. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of projects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns. You'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are assigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly see yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can delete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided" 
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints 
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] 
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios" 
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable 
   � Mark ambiguous requirements 
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved) 
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details" 
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning) 
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a team member working on projects, I want to select my identity from a list of predefined users, view available projects, and manage tasks on a Kanban board so that I can track project progress, collaborate with team members through comments, and maintain visibility of my assigned work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application starts, **When** I access Taskify, **Then** I see a list of 5 predefined users (1 product manager, 4 engineers) to choose from
2. **Given** I select a user identity, **When** I proceed to the main view, **Then** I see a list of 3 sample projects available
3. **Given** I'm viewing the project list, **When** I click on a project, **Then** I see the Kanban board with columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done"
4. **Given** I'm viewing a Kanban board, **When** I see task cards, **Then** cards assigned to me appear in a different color than other cards
5. **Given** I'm on a Kanban board, **When** I drag a task card to a different column, **Then** the task status updates to match the new column
6. **Given** I click on a task card, **When** the task details open, **Then** I can add unlimited comments, assign the task to any of the 5 users, and change the task status
7. **Given** I've made comments on a task, **When** I view my comments, **Then** I can edit and delete only my own comments, not those made by others
8. **Given** other users have made comments on a task, **When** I view their comments, **Then** I can see them but cannot edit or delete them

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a task card is dragged to an invalid drop zone?
- How does the system handle concurrent task status updates from multiple users?
- What occurs when a user attempts to assign a task to a non-existent user?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a user selection screen with exactly 5 predefined users (1 product manager, 4 engineers)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow user selection without requiring passwords or authentication
- **FR-003**: System MUST display exactly 3 sample projects after user selection
- **FR-004**: System MUST present Kanban boards with 4 standard columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done"
- **FR-005**: System MUST visually distinguish task cards assigned to the current user from other cards using different colors
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow drag-and-drop functionality to move task cards between Kanban columns
- **FR-007**: System MUST update task status when cards are moved between columns
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow unlimited comments to be added to any task card
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow task assignment to any of the 5 predefined users from within a task card
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to edit and delete only their own comments
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent users from editing or deleting comments made by other users
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow task status changes directly from the task card interface
- **FR-013**: System MUST persist all task changes, comments, and assignments in PostgreSQL database
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain state when navigating between projects and returning to previous views with session persistence duration of 2 hours

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents team members with predefined roles (product manager or engineer), no authentication required
- **Project**: Container for related tasks, exactly 3 sample projects available  
- **Task**: Work items that can be assigned, commented on, and moved between status columns
- **Comment**: User-generated content associated with tasks, editable/deletable only by creator
- **Task Status**: Current state of a task (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done)
