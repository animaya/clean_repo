# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: File Upload Interface
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive file upload interface for the Parakeet audio transcription system that supports both drag-and-drop and URL-based audio file uploads with automatic format conversion via FFmpeg. This interface will serve as the primary entry point for users to submit audio files for transcription, ensuring seamless handling of various audio formats while maintaining the privacy-first local processing approach.

The system will provide real-time upload progress, file validation, and automatic conversion to optimize files for the parakeet-mlx transcription engine, all while keeping data processing local to the user's machine.

## User Stories

**As a content creator**, I want to drag and drop audio files from my computer so that I can quickly upload podcast episodes, interviews, or recordings for transcription without navigating through file dialogs.

**As a researcher**, I want to paste URLs of audio files so that I can transcribe remote audio content directly without downloading files manually first.

**As a user processing multiple files**, I want to see upload progress and conversion status so that I understand what's happening with my files and can track processing completion.

**As a privacy-conscious user**, I want all file processing to happen locally so that my audio content never leaves my device during the upload and conversion process.

**As a user with various audio formats**, I want automatic format conversion so that I can upload any common audio format (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, etc.) and have it optimized for transcription without manual conversion.
