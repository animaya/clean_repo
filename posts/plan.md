# Comprehensive Marketing Posting Factory Plan

## üéØ System Overview
A multi-agent posting factory where human workers request content on topics, and a sophisticated router system orchestrates specialized creative agents to generate multiple post variations for approval.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### 1. **Router Agent** (Master Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Receives requests, conducts intelligent questioning, routes to specialists
- **Key Functions**:
  - Parse initial post topic requests
  - Ask contextual questions (platform, audience, tone, CTAs, timeline)
  - Route to appropriate creative agents based on requirements
  - Coordinate parallel processing and manage approvals

### 2. **Creative SMM Agents** (Content Specialists)
- **Platform Agents**: LinkedIn Professional, Twitter Engagement, Instagram Visual, Facebook Community, TikTok Trend
- **Style Agents**: Professional/Corporate, Casual/Conversational, Technical/Educational, Humorous, Inspirational
- **Output**: 3-5 variations per agent with different hooks, formats, and CTAs

### 3. **Context Management System**
- **CLAUDE.md Integration**: Brand guidelines, voice, successful templates
- **Dynamic Context**: Real-time brand compliance, audience personas, performance data
- **Learning Loop**: Continuously updated with successful patterns and feedback

### 4. **Workflow Orchestration**
- **TodoWrite Management**: Dynamic task creation, parallel processing, status tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Brand compliance checking, platform validation
- **Approval Process**: Structured presentation, feedback collection, iteration cycles

## üéØ Expected Workflow
1. Human worker: "I need posts about AI automation for small businesses"
2. Router Agent: Asks clarifying questions about platform, audience, tone
3. Routes to LinkedIn Professional + Technical agents simultaneously
4. Generates 6-10 post variations with different approaches
5. Presents organized options to human for approval
6. Iterates based on feedback if needed

This system leverages Claude Code's advanced capabilities for intelligent task orchestration, context management, and multi-agent coordination without requiring initial coding - just clever prompting and subagent utilization.
