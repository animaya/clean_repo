# Agent Coordination & Workflow Patterns

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

### Parallel Processing Rules
**Simultaneous Agent Activation:**
- Router Agent can activate multiple platform agents simultaneously
- Style agents can be applied to platform agent outputs
- Maximum recommended concurrent agents: 5 (to maintain quality control)
- Each agent operates independently but shares brand context

**Agent Combination Strategies:**
1. **Platform-First**: Activate multiple platform agents for same topic
2. **Style-First**: Apply multiple styles to same content, then adapt to platforms
3. **Hybrid**: Platform agents with specific style instructions
4. **Sequential**: One agent output becomes input for another agent

### Agent Selection Matrix

#### Content Goal â†’ Agent Selection
**Brand Awareness:**
- Primary: Instagram Visual + Twitter Engagement
- Secondary: LinkedIn Professional + Facebook Community
- Style: Inspirational + Storytelling

**Lead Generation:**
- Primary: LinkedIn Professional + Facebook Community
- Secondary: Twitter Engagement (for traffic driving)
- Style: Professional + Educational

**Engagement/Community Building:**
- Primary: Twitter Engagement + Instagram Visual + Facebook Community
- Secondary: TikTok Trend (if audience appropriate)
- Style: Conversational + Humorous (if brand appropriate)

**Thought Leadership:**
- Primary: LinkedIn Professional + Twitter Engagement
- Secondary: YouTube Educational (if applicable)
- Style: Professional + Technical/Educational

**Product Launch:**
- Primary: All platform agents activated
- Secondary: All style agents for variety
- Approach: Coordinated campaign across platforms

## Workflow Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Topic Explosion
**Use Case:** Single topic needs content for multiple platforms
**Process:**
1. Router Agent receives topic and requirements
2. Activates 3-5 platform agents simultaneously
3. Each platform agent generates 3 variations
4. Router compiles and presents organized options
5. Human selects preferred variations for each platform

**TodoWrite Structure:**
```
- Activate LinkedIn Agent for [topic]
- Activate Twitter Agent for [topic]  
- Activate Instagram Agent for [topic]
- Activate Facebook Agent for [topic]
- Compile and organize platform-specific variations
- Present options to human for selection
```

### Pattern 2: Style Exploration
**Use Case:** Explore different messaging approaches for same content
**Process:**
1. Router Agent receives topic and platform preference
2. Activates 3-4 style agents for chosen platform
3. Each style agent generates content in their approach
4. Router presents style variations for comparison
5. Human selects preferred style approach

**TodoWrite Structure:**
```
- Apply Professional style to [topic] for [platform]
- Apply Conversational style to [topic] for [platform]
- Apply Educational style to [topic] for [platform]
- Compare style effectiveness and brand alignment
- Present style options with recommendations
```

### Pattern 3: Campaign Coordination
**Use Case:** Multi-platform campaign with consistent messaging
**Process:**
1. Router Agent receives campaign theme and timeline
2. Develops master messaging framework
3. Activates all relevant platform agents with campaign brief
4. Ensures message consistency while allowing platform optimization
5. Creates campaign calendar with coordinated posting schedule

**TodoWrite Structure:**
```
- Develop campaign messaging framework for [theme]
- Brief all platform agents on campaign requirements
- Generate coordinated content variations per platform
- Create posting timeline with optimal scheduling
- Prepare campaign launch materials
- Set up performance tracking framework
```

### Pattern 4: Content Series Development
**Use Case:** Multi-part educational or storytelling series
**Process:**
1. Router Agent receives series concept and scope
2. Breaks series into individual topics/episodes
3. Assigns different angles to appropriate agents
4. Ensures series coherence across all parts
5. Develops series arc and engagement strategy

**TodoWrite Structure:**
```
- Outline [series name] with [X] parts
- Assign series part 1 to [appropriate agent]
- Assign series part 2 to [appropriate agent]
- Ensure series coherence and progression
- Develop series promotion and cross-linking strategy
- Create series completion celebration content
```

## Agent Communication Protocols

### Information Sharing Between Agents
**Shared Context:**
- All agents access same brand template files
- Successful content patterns shared across agents
- Performance feedback incorporated into future generations
- Brand voice consistency maintained across all agents

**Agent-to-Agent Handoffs:**
- Platform agent output can be input for style agent refinement
- Style agent output can inform platform agent adaptations
- Router Agent facilitates all inter-agent communication
- Clear documentation of handoff requirements and expectations

### Quality Assurance Framework
**Multi-Agent QA Process:**
1. **Individual Agent QA**: Each agent self-checks against brand guidelines
2. **Cross-Agent Consistency**: Router Agent checks for message alignment
3. **Platform Optimization**: Platform-specific requirements validated
4. **Brand Compliance**: Final brand voice and visual consistency check
5. **Human Review**: Organized presentation for human approval

### Conflict Resolution
**When Agents Generate Conflicting Approaches:**
- Router Agent identifies conflicting elements
- References brand templates for resolution criteria
- Prioritizes brand consistency over agent preferences
- Escalates to human review when conflicts can't be resolved
- Documents resolution patterns for future reference

## Workflow Templates

### Template 1: Daily Content Generation
**Frequency:** Daily posting needs
**Scope:** 1-2 platforms, single topic
**Process:**
```
1. Receive daily topic request
2. Quick brand/audience reference check
3. Activate primary platform agent
4. Generate 3 variations
5. Select and schedule best option
6. Monitor performance for learning
```

**TodoWrite Pattern:**
```
- Identify today's content topic

```

### Template 2: Weekly Content Batch

- Market timing considerations agents can't assess
- Strategic pivots that require immediate adjustment
- Crisis communication requiring special handling

### Emergency Response Protocols
**Crisis Communication:**

- All content filtered through crisis communication guidelines
- Accelerated approval process for time-sensitive responses

### Quality Control Escalation
**When Agent Output Needs Review:**
- Brand voice inconsistencies across agents
- Platform guideline violations
- Content quality below brand standards
- Agent coordination failures
