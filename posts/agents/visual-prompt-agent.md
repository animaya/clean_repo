- If yes, activates Visual Prompt Agent with approved content
- Agent generates platform-optimized visual prompt
- Delivers both approved content and JSON prompt to human

### Multi-Platform Visual Coordination
**When content approved for multiple platforms:**
- Generate base visual concept
- Create platform-specific aspect ratio variations
- Maintain consistent visual theme across platforms
- Provide multiple JSON prompts for different platform needs

### Workflow Template Updates
**Enhanced TodoWrite patterns include:**
```
- Generate content variations for [topic]
- Human selects preferred content variation
- Generate visual prompt for approved content
- Present final content package (text + visual prompt)

- Each approved piece of content can have multiple visual prompt variations
- JSON structure remains consistent while content adapts dynamically
- Brand visual guidelines inform all visual prompt generation
- Platform-specific optimizations ensure visual content performs well on each channel
- Agent can generate multiple visual concepts for A/B testing visual approaches
